        Hello! My name is Shi'an, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo- Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Before coming to the U, I completed my Master of Applied Science studies with a scholarship from the University of Ottawa, Canada where I enjoyed three wonderful years. Prior to that, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree in People's Republic of China. Generally speaking, I am interested in any subject involving analysis. I am really fascinated by analytical research, and this is the reason why I chose to do graduate studies. I have a background in control systems and transportation engineering. I believe it would be great to work with Professor Levin to apply the ideas in systems science to the control and operation of autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, among many others. Apart from research, I am really into tennis which I have been playing for nearly seven years. I am also a big fun of exploration into the world. I have traveled to many places all over the globe, such as Beijing, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Zurich, London, Abu Dhabi, etc. Last but not least, I am on the way of learning different languages, including French and Spanish.

       Hi, my name is Te. I’m a graduate student pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo-Engineering at the University of Minnesota. I got my Bachelor’s degree in traffic engineering at Chang'an University and my Master's degree in transportation engineering at Southeast University. I have a great interest in mathematical modeling, traffic simulation, traffic control, and CAVs. I am glad to join Dr. Levin's group. I am a fanatical basketball fan. In my spare time, I like to watch NBA on the spot.

       Hello! My name is Jacob Margolis and I received my Bachelor's degree in Economics at Brandeis University in 2021, and am now pursuing a Master's degree in Transportation Engineering at the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo-Engineering. As we create new infrastructure and modify the existing stock to accommodate connected automated vehicles (CAVs), it is essential that we are also creating sustainable, equitable, and people-oriented urban transportation networks. To that end, I aim to carve out a niche for pedestrians, transit, and bicycles into our understanding and modeling of CAVs and smart cities. In my free time, I enjoy reading, bicycling, hiking, and watching theatre.

       I am a sophomore studying computer science. My past projects include assembling a robot that uses computer vision to identify a person as male or female using a convolutional neural network and developing/publishing an iOS application called Helium Adventure to the App Store. Currently, I am creating a simulation for the use of autonomous electric vehicles in ridesharing. The simulation ensures that the vehicles pick up and drop passengers at designated destinations in the most efficient way possible using a shortest path algorithm. In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, weightlifting, and listening to music.​

        <h3 id="joinme">Future graduate students</h3>

        <p>
I have at least one opening for M.S. or Ph.D. students to study traffic flow theory and network modeling of autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, and related topics.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Program structure</h5>
        
        <p>
        Graduate students work with me to lead one or more research projects. 
        Research projects include novel methodologies for predicting or optimizing transportation systems, detailed simulations of such systems, or combinations thereof.
        MS students usually work on one project, which becomes their thesis and a peer-reviewed journal publication. PhD students complete several projects, which become chapters of their dissertation and lead author journal articles for their CV.
        Through the process of completing these projects, graduate students learn skills relevant to transportation engineering research.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Each graduate student meets individually with me for 1 hour per week for individualized instruction on their research projects. 
        I also hold weekly group meetings during which graduate students practice presenting their research, reading and understanding journal articles, and soliciting feedback from their peers.
        Graduate students also take 3 courses per semester on theory and skills for transportation engineering work. 
        (After passing the written exam, PhD students often reduce their course load to focus on their dissertation research.)
        </p>
        
        <h5>Qualifications</h5>
        <p>
​The ideal candidate will have one or more of the following skills:
        </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Background in Transportation Engineering</li>
<li>Mathematical modeling and/or optimization</li>
<li>Computer programming</li>
<li>Prior research experience</li>
</ul>
        <p>
Applicants should hold a B.S. or M.S. in Civil Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field. ​​
        </p>
        
        <p>
            ​Graduate students will be fully funded (tuition and stipend) as a Graduate Research or Teaching Assistant. Positions are available for both the fall and spring semesters. <b>If you are interested, please <a href="http://www.cege.umn.edu/prospective/graduate/how-to-apply.html" target="_blank">apply for admission</a> to the University of Minnesota and request me as your advisor on your application.</b>

        <h3>Undergraduate research assistants</h3>

        <p>
​I'm interested in hiring undergraduate research assistants on projects relating to autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems.  
        </p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>UROP/URS scholarships and paid research assistantships are available.</li>
    <li>Students can also receive course credit for research instead.</li>
​</ul>
        
        <h5>Job description</h5>
        <p>
            
            Undergraduate students are often involved in obtaining numerical results about transportation systems through conducting simulations and/pr developing software of methodological models developed by graduate students.
            Each undergraduate RA is paired with a graduate student to provide frequent guidance and supervision, and primarily works on a research project led by that graduate student.
            Many of my undergraduate RAs have become co-authors on peer-reviewed journal articles, and some of them are even the lead author.
            Research projects build experience in applying course skills to real problems, studies transportation systems and theory in greater depth than is covered in undergraduate courses, 
            and prepares students for graduate studies.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Qualifications</h5>
        <p>
Applicants should be studying Civil, Industrial, or Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Urban Planning, or a related field. Applicants with interests in mathematical modeling and optimization, transportation engineering, and/or computer programming are especially encouraged to apply.
        </p>
