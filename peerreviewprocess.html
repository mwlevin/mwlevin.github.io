    <h3>Peer review process</h3>  
    
    <p>After you finish writing a paper, how do you get it published in a journal? This post describes that process. </p>
    
    <h5>Choosing a journal</h5>
    
    <p>The first step, even before you begin writing most of the paper, is choosing which journal you want to send the paper too. Different journals have different writing styles. You can get an idea of the writing style by looking at recent papers published in that journal.
    </p>
    
    <p>
Generally, you want to get your paper into the highest ranked journal possible. This has several benefits. First, anyone evaluating your publication record will pay attention to the reputation of the journals in which your papers appear. Second, other researchers pay more attention to papers in top journals, so publishing in top journals gets more attention.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The highest-ranked journals in transportation engineering are <i>Transportation Science</i> and <i>Transportation Research Part B</i>. Both require heavily methodological contributions and accept only the best papers. You should absolutely strive to write a paper for these journals, but it is not necessary. I did not have any papers accepted or even in review at these journals when I was hired as a faculty member. Close behind are <i>Transportation Research Parts A, C, D,</i> and <i>E</i>, and <i>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</i>. Farther behind that are <i>Networks and Spatial Economics</i>, <i>Transportation</i>, <i>Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering</i>, <i>Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems</i>, <i>Transportmetrica A</i> and <i>B</i>, <i>ASCE Journal of Transportation Engineering</i>, <i>Journal of Advanced Transportation</i>, etc.
    </p>
    
    <h5>Organization of a journal</h5>
    
    <p>
    Each journal is run by the <b>editor-in-chief</b>, who is usually an active researcher and a professor. They usually delegate the editorial duties to an <b>associate editor</b> or member of the <b>editorial board</b> who has more relevant expertise. The editor is responsible for making accept/reject decisions. The editor enlists the help of several (usually 3) reviewers who are supposed to be experts on the paper's topic, to review the paper in detail and recommend whether the paper should be accepted or rejected. After a paper is accepted, it will eventually be published in on of the journal's issues. Journals are usually published one or more times a year, and your paper will usually be posted as a preprint before it is officially published in one of these issues. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The <b>publisher</b> of the journal (e.g. Elsevier) is responsible for distributing the journal, and usually charges fees to users (or libraries) for journal access, or fees to authors to publish papers open-access. The associate editors and reviewers are volunteering their time to run the journal. Keep this in mind when you consider your expectations for the duration of the peer review process. Most of the people involved are volunteers whose are funded by their own research and teaching.
    </p>
    
    <p>
This cost model exists because prior to the internet, distributing journals was difficult. Although papers can now be made available for less cost, the existing journals have a high reputation which is valuable for authors and readers. It is not easy to develop a new highly-ranked journal, and most authors (i.e. grad students and junior faculty) have little incentive to publish in anything other than highly-ranked journals.
    </p> 
    
    
    <h5>Paper submission</h5>
    
    <p>
        When submitting a paper, you need to gather several documents:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The paper itself. Some journals have formatting requirements, and these can usually be found in the "author guidelines" or "information for authors" on the submission site. If you write in LaTeX, journals usually provide a LaTeX formatting template to use.</li>
<li>A cover letter, addressed to the editor-in-chief, which explains why this paper is a good fit for the journal, and formally states that the paper is not being considered elsewhere. This is also a good place to write specific notes to the editor-in-chief.</li>
<li>Some journals ask for a list of recommended reviewers. If you do not have specific faculty in mind, you can make suggestions based on the authors of papers you cited.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    The <b>lead author</b> or <b>first author</b> is the author whose name appears first on the paper. In transportation engineering, this is usually the author who contributed most to the paper. The <b>corresponding author</b> is the author who handles correspondence with the journal and authors, including during the peer review process. I usually prefer for the grad student leading the paper to be both the lead and corresponding author.
    </p>
     
    
    <h5>Peer review process</h5>
    <p>
    After receiving the paper, the editor-in-chief will usually forward it to one of the associate editors, who will then invite reviewers. Remember that the reviewers, like the associate editor, are volunteers. It can therefore be difficult to find researchers who are willing to accept review requests. Top researchers often receive many more review requests per year than they can reasonably accept. The process of finding reviewers, and waiting for them to submit their reports for the first round of reviews, is usually the most time-intensive part of the process. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
The reviewers will read your paper in depth, and make 1 of 4 recommendations:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Accept.</b> The paper should be accepted as is.</li>
<li><b>Minor revisions.</b> The paper needs some minor changes, and the editor should accept the paper after the authors make those changes.</li>
<li><b>Major revisions.</b> The paper needs some major changes but has the potential for being published. The authors should revise the paper and send the revised version back to the editor (and then back to the reviewers) for re-review.</li>
<li><b>Reject.</b> The paper is inappropriate for the journal, not a contribution, or technically incorrect. </li>
        </ol><p>
            After receiving these recommendations, the editor then makes a <b>decision</b> of one of these options and sends that decision to the authors. It is common for reviewers to have different recommendations, and it is the editor's job to combine those recommendations into a single decision. It is possible for a paper to be rejected if 1 reviewer recommends rejection and the others recommend major revisions, depending on the editor's opinion of the reviews. The editor will include the review comments to the authors with the reviewer's names removed. Sometimes the editor will reject a paper without review if they do not believe it is relevant or sufficient for the journal. This is known as a <b>desk rejection</b>. 
        </p>    
    
        <p>
Reviewers are intentionally kept anonymous to avoid repercussions from authors. This helps reviewers feel able to criticize papers even by well-known researchers. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
Most papers receive a decision of major revisions or reject after the first round. If the paper is rejected, you should address the relevant comments and revise the paper in preparation for submitting to a new journal (assuming you still believe it is publishable). For major revisions, you should do your best to address each of the comments. As you address them, create a "response to comments" document that details the response to the comment and any steps taken to address it. I usually use the form below, with color-coding to distinguish my responses from changes to the paper. 
        </p>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Comment 1.
<ul class="circle">
    <li>Response 1.</li>
    <li>Changes to paper.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
            <p>
Keep in mind that when reviewers criticize the paper, the easiest way to satisfy them is to change the paper to negate the criticism. If they are confused or mistaken about your paper, change the paper to avoid that confusion. If they ask for new results, you might be able to convince reviewers that such results are too difficult to obtain, but it's often easier to satisfy them by providing such results. Papers can and do get rejected in the second round of reviews if reviewers do not like your responses.             
</p>
        
<p>       
The review process may continue for several iterations until all reviewers are satisfied with your paper (or at least the editor is satisfied). 
</p>

<p>
Once you have submitted a paper to a journal, you may list the paper as "in review in _" on your CV. However, most readers know that submitting a paper is not the same thing as paper acceptance, so a paper in review is not worth as much as an accepted or published paper on your CV. 
     </p>   
     
     <h5>Acceptance and publication</h5>
     <p>
     Once your paper is accepted, congratulations! You now have an accepted paper, and can list it as "accepted" on your CV. There is some more paperwork involved before publication, but the difficult part is over.
     </p>
     
     <p>
Somewhere during the review process or after acceptance, you will be asked to upload source files for your paper. This includes LaTeX source files and figure files, usually in PDF, EPS, or TIFF form. These will be used by the journal staff to revise your paper to fit their formatting requirements. 
     </p>
     
     <p>
Afterwards, the journal staff will send you a proof, which is a draft version of how the paper will appear in the journal. This is your last chance to correct typos or errors in the paper, otherwise those errors will appear in the final version. (Note that the reviewers and editor will not correct typos for you. That is not their job, and most reviewers are too busy to point out every typo.) Once you submit the proof, there are usually some transfer of copyright forms to complete, as well as the option to order printed versions. After you submit those forms, your work is done and you can wait for the journal to officially publish the paper.
