         <h3>Purpose of group meetings</h3>
         
         <p>
         The group meetings occur every week during the semester, and usually have two parts, alternating every other week:
         </p>
         <ul class="disc">
             <li>Research presentation by one of the students</li>
             <li>Paper discussion (led by one of the students)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
.Like most things in grad school, you get out of it what you put into it. The more effort you put in, the more benefit you will see. Here is what you are expected to get out of the group meetings.
         </p>
         
         <h5>Research presentations</h5>
         <p>
         The primary purpose of the research presentations is for us to practice presenting. Engineering work is rarely useful unless other people accept it and make use of it, which often requires good communication and presentation skills. If you present at 2 conferences per year over a PhD, that is maybe 10 presentations total. The more you present, the better you will be at presenting your work after graduation. 
         </p>
         <p>
For the research presentations, prepare a 20&#8211;30min presentation (conference length). It does not have to be a complete research project. You could present some incomplete ideas to receive feedback from other (more senior) students. 
         </p>
         <p>
If you are the one presenting, that practice is obvious. If you are listening to a presentation, pay attention to what the presenter does well (or does not do well). For instance, do they talk through their mathematics too quickly for you to understand? Do they motivate their problem and approach sufficiently for you to care? Watch the performance of other speakers, and learn from them for your own presentations.
         </p>
         <p>
As the presenter, you should also receive feedback from other students, such as suggestions for how to solve problems more efficiently or other techniques to use. Since receiving such feedback can be uncomfortable, this is why we have group meeting presentations where the only people hearing that feedback are the other grad students in the group. 
         </p>
         <p>
The secondary goal is for you to have more awareness about what other group members are working on, and by extension, what other researchers in the field are working on. This will help you have a more general view of the research field.
         </p>
     
         <h5>Paper discussions</h5>
         
         <p>
         Reading research papers is difficult, and it is not a skill usually taught in undergrad. The purpose of this meeting is to practice reading papers.  Reading papers quickly is an important skill to have because you will always be studying the work of others throughout a research career.
         </p>
         
         <p>
During a paper discussion, everyone is expected to have read the paper beforehand. The purpose of the discussion is to talk about concepts that we didn't understand, like why do the authors make assumption X, or why did they write equation Y like this? 
         </p>
         
         <p>
I usually ask students to lead one paper discussion per semester. This forces you to understand at least one paper in detail. You do not need to understand everything in the paper, but you need to be familiar with it enough to ask interesting questions for discussion. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
I personally usually spend around 1hr or less per group meeting paper (including when I am leading the discussion). It will take you more time when you are starting out. See this post on how to read papers efficiently.
         </p>
         
         <p>
Other students will choose papers that are unrelated to your topic. This is a feature, not a bug; you will get valuable practice reading papers that are somewhat unfamiliar to you. The purpose of this practice is to help you learn how to learn by reading papers. By the end of your PhD, you should be able to learn new topics independently (without taking a course) by reading the papers of other researchers.
