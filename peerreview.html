    <h3>How to peer review a journal manuscript</h3>  
    
    <p>Before reading how to peer review manuscripts, it is helpful to be familiar with the peer review process.

    <p>
The purpose of journals is to publish results that are valuable and interesting to readers. What makes results worth publishing?  </p>
  <ul class="disc">
      <li><b>Contributions.</b> Academics want to learn by reading papers, and a manuscript that mostly repeats existing work offers little new knowledge compared with existing papers. Contributions can take the form of novel mathematical models, new solution algorithms, and/or new knowledge about empirical results.</li>
      <li><b>Relevance.</b> Each journal normally focuses on one area of research. For example, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological focuses on methodological papers. Regardless of how novel or well-written a simulation-based manuscript is, it probably won't fall into the scope of Part B.</li>
<li><b>Correctness.</b> Novel results are only valid if the authors used correct methodologies, correct mathematics, etc. Good authors will check their own correctness, but everyone makes mistakes and it's possible to overlook issues.</li>
<li><b>Applicability.</b> Are the assumptions realistic to the problem being studied? Authors should try to justify their assumptions, but reviewers may not agree with their justification. If the assumptions are impractical, then the rest of the manuscript may not be useful. </li>
  </ul>   

    <p>
        <b>Manuscripts</b> are paper drafts that have been submitted to a journal for publication. After they are published, they are called <b>journal papers</b>​.
    </p>
    
    
    <h5>Who are peer reviewers?</h5>
    
    <p>
    Journal editors are not experts in every topic or sub-topic. The editor-in-chief appoints associate editors who are more knowledgeable about other topics, but even they are not an expert. Instead, they appoint peer reviewers (usually faculty or postdocs) to review manuscripts and give their opinions. Usually, 2-3 reviewers are appointed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
​Peer reviewers and associate editors are almost always volunteers, and are not paid for their time. ​Although editors will give reviewers a deadline for their review, there are limited consequences for making or missing the deadline. Some of those consequences include:
    </p>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>The editor might cancel your review request and invite other reviewers if you take too long. However, inviting a new reviewer slows down the review process, so editors are usually wiling to grant extensions of review deadlines if reviewers request it (email the editor).</li>
<li>The editor may have a personal like or dislike of you which could be relevant if you want to be a journal editor, conference committee member, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Reviewing a manuscript</h5>
    
    <p>As a peer reviewer, your goal is to help the editor make one of four decisions on the manuscript: </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Accept.</b> The manuscript should be accepted as is.</li>
<li><b>Minor revisions.</b> The manuscript needs some minor changes, and the editor should accept the manuscript after the authors make those changes.</li>
<li><b>Major revisions.</b> The manuscript needs some major changes but has the potential for being published. The authors should revise the manuscript and send the revised version back to you for re-review. Major changes could take the form of new (or revised) mathematical results, new numerical results, issues with the writing, or anything else that you want to make sure the authors change before the manuscript is published.</li>
<li><b>Reject.</b> The manuscript is inappropriate for the journal, not a sufficient contribution, has major technical correctness issues that interfere with the results, or would require so many changes that the authors would have to rewrite most of it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Almost all manuscripts either receive "major revisions" or "rejection" during the 1st round of review. It is rare for a manuscript to be so good at the start that you don't request any changes to it.
    </p>
    <p>
To help the editor make this decision, you need to provide more details on how you came to this decision. These details are provided in two parts.
    </p>
    <h6>Comments to the editor</h6>
    
    <p>These are comments that only the editor will see, where you can explain what you like and dislike about the manuscript. First, start by giving a brief (2-3 sentence) summary of the manuscript to the editor. You probably know more than the editor about this topic, so your description of the authors' work is useful to the editor. After the summary of the manuscript contents, give a brief summary of your evaluation.
    </p>
    
    
    <h6>Comments to the authors</h6> 
    <p>The authors are intended to see these comments, and these are issues that you believe need to be addressed before the manuscript can be published. If you're recommending rejection, then these are the unfixable issues that should prevent the manuscript from ever being published.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Focus on the 4 categories described above - contributions, relevance, correctness, and applicability. Unlike reading a published journal paper, your goal is to find every major issue with the manuscript. If the contributions are weak, say so. If you believe there is a technical error, or if you have difficulty understanding an equation due to a lack of explanation by the authors, make a comment about that. This is your opportunity to influence the quality of the manuscript before it is published. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
Don't spend your time correcting spelling or grammatical errors in the writing. The job of a peer reviewer is to focus on the scientific content. If the errors in the writing make it difficult to read, give that comment to the authors and try to understand the manuscript as best as you can. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
If you spot occasional errors in the equations, simulation details, etc., then it is nice to point them out for the authors. However, if there are many errors throughout the manuscript, that's a major issue and correcting them is not your job.
    </p>
    
    <p>
Sometimes I will split this section into "major comments" and "minor comments", where "major comments" are technical issues, issues with assumptions, etc. and "minor comments" are issues with notation, typos in equations, etc.
    </p>
     
    <h5>Format of a completed review</h5>
    <p>
    The submitted review should include the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A recommendation (accept, minor revisions, major revisions, reject).</li>
        <li>Comments to the editor, including a summary of the manuscript and an explanation for your recommendation.</li>
<li>Comments to the authors describing issues with the manuscript.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h5>Multiple rounds of review</h5>
    <p>
    After collecting all reviewer decisions, the editor makes the actual decision on the manuscript (accept, minor revisions, major revisions, or reject). Sometimes reviewers will disagree on the decision, and it is the job of the editor to make a single decision on the manuscript.
    </p>
    
    <p>
If the decision is major revisions, the authors will be asked to revise their manuscript, and the editors will send the revised manuscript to the same reviewers to review changes. For 2nd (or 3rd, or 4th, etc.) rounds of review, you don't need to review the entire manuscript again. You only need to review the authors' responses to your comments from the previous round of review. Essentially, in the previous round, you had some concerns with the manuscript and you didn't want it published in that form. After the authors have revised it, you need to check whether their revisions sufficiently addressed your concerns.
​</p>
    
    <p>
Usually, the decision to a 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc. round of review is accept, minor revisions, or major revisions (the authors' revisions were inadequate). Occasionally, a reviewer who is "on the fence" about a manuscript, or who didn't like it in the 1st round, might recommend rejection at later rounds of review.
    </p>
    
    <p>
It's normal for one reviewer to request major revisions while other reviewers are satisfied with the manuscript as is. If you believe new results or other changes are needed, feel free to keep requesting major revisions until those changes are made. (However, editors may overrule you if they disagree.)
    </p>  
    
    <h5>Time management</h5>
    <p>
        Paper reviews are one of the tasks in academia where your performance is rewarded with more manuscripts to review from editors. For my students, I will set limits on how many papers you are asked to help review by me. After you start getting review invitations directly from editors, you should set your own limits on how many papers to review. My personal rule is to give back as much work as I create for the review process. For example, if each of my manuscripts requires 3 reviewers, and I submit 4 manuscripts per year, then I try to review 12 manuscripts for journals per year.</p>
