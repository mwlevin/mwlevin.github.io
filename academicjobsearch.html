    <h3>Academic job search</h3>  
    
    <p>
        The academic job hunt process itself takes months, and is quite extensive. This is intended to give an overview of the process, with more specific feedback given as you go through it.
    </p>
    
    <h5>What are schools looking for?</h5>
    
    <p>
    Most schools hope that the faculty the hire will stay there for many years, possibly their entire career. Therefore, they place a high priority on hiring faculty with high potential for success in research and teaching. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
Universities range on a continuum from research-focused (think top-ranked R1 schools) to teaching-focused. There are pros and cons to each. The more research-oriented the school, the more they are looking for research achievements in their candidates. Teaching-oriented schools place more priority on candidates who are skilled and passionate about teaching. However, all schools want to hire someone who is ready to step into the classroom. 
    </p>
    
    <h5>Faculty job search process</h5>
    
    <p>
    Each department must receive permission to hire from the dean of their college. After doing so, they will form a search committee. This usually includes 3 faculty in the subject area and 2 faculty from other areas. This means that, as a job candidate, you have to both impress faculty who are knowledgeable about your field (transportation) and those who are not (e.g. structures or water resources). 
    </p>
    
    <ol>
<li>The search committee will post an advertisement that says what level they are looking to hire at, and at what topic. The level is usually assistant professor, but sometimes schools only want to hire more senior faculty. The topic could be transportation in general, or more specifically focused on a topic within transportation like automated vehicles. This advertisement usually gets distributed between September-November for hires starting in August of the next year.</li>
<li>After the listed deadline, the search committee reviews applications. First, they will look through your cover letter, CV to make sure your application is relevant to the job. Then they will read your research and teaching statements, and compare to other applicants. If you get past this stage, they may start to ask your references for recommendation letters.</li>
<li>Many search committees will have phone interviews with the top 10 or so candidates to decide which to invite for in-person interviews. Other schools skip right to the in-person stage.</li>
<li>The search committee invites their top candidates to the school for a 1-2 day interview. Usually only 4-5 candidates are interviewed in person because interviewing costs time and money for the school. At this point, you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you; if you are the top candidate, they want you to accept their offer. </li>
<li>The search committee makes an offer to their top candidate. If he/she declines, they may make an offer to their second choice. </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
Getting through the application stage is the most challenging. On a normal year, there are often 200-250 people applying for 30-40 openings. 
    </p>
    
    <h5>Preparation</h5>
    
    <p>
    Preparation occurs throughout your PhD (and sometimes even before it). 
    </p>
    
    
    <h6>Teaching</h6>
    <p>
    Spend at least one semester, and maybe more, as a TA for undergrad classes, especially a TA who is leading TA sessions. Getting additional experience in writing homeworks or exams is also beneficial. This is probably the best demonstration you can have of being ready to teach on day 1 of the faculty job.
    </p>
    
    <h6>
Research</h6>
    
    <p>I've been advised that 6 papers (4 published or accepted) is the minimum needed to be considered for a faculty job. This number has increased over time, and you will be competing with students who have more research achievements. Note that 6 papers is a quantitative measure, but both quality and quantity matter. 6 papers in mediocre journals is not worth as much as 3 papers in top journals.
    </p>
    
    <p>
These are job skills and achievements that you should be working on during the PhD. Essentially, the PhD is an apprenticeship training program for being a professional researcher. 
    </p>
    <p>
By now, you should be getting the impression that the academic job search is a very competitive process. I'll just reiterate that here: many students aspire to being a professor, but there aren't enough faculty openings for every applicant to be successful.
    </p>
     
    <h6>Applying for jobs</h6>
    
    <p>
    Almost all applications follow the same format:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Cover letter</b> (1&#8211;2 pages). This is your opportunity to describe why you fit the position and include any relevant information that does not fit elsewhere.</li>
        <li><b>Curriculum vit&#230;.</b>  You should be maintaining your CV throughout the PhD.</li>
<li><b>References.</b>  These should be other faculty who know you well. Having external references is good if they can speak well about you. </li>
<li><b>Research statement</b>  (2 pages). Describe your research goals for the next 6 years. What research topics do you intend to study? Unlike your PhD research, you need to propose enough questions and topics to keep multiple PhD students busy for several years. I advise you to aim for 3 topics. Fewer than 3 might suggest a lack of ideas, whereas more than 3 limits the space available for detail. One of these topics is likely to be based on extending your dissertation research. Remember that you need to impress faculty who are not in the transportation group, so spend some time motivating the research topics. The research statement should not be focused on your previous research papers. Mention your previous work only to convince the committee that you can perform the future research you propose. End the research statement by discussing what sort of research group you intend to have. How many students, and how do you intend to fund them? Look at the department website to find a few faculty with similar interests who you could collaborate with and mention them by name here.</li>
<li><b>Teaching statement</b>  (2 pages). This statement serves 2 purposes. First, you can use it to convince the committee that you have experience teaching and a philosophy on how you plan to act as the main instructor of a course. Most students do not spend much time thinking about teaching. I took classes on education during undergrad, and concepts like active learning, backwards design, and Bloom's Taxonomy were at the front of my teaching philosophy. Second, you should discuss which courses you would teach at the school. Schools are usually looking for you to teach some required undergraduate courses and add a new PhD level course related to your PhD work. Do look at the course catalog of the department and offer to teach 2-3 undergraduate courses. Usually they have required courses on transportation engineering, probability & statistics, and computer applications with additional transportation electives. Mention these courses by name and number to show that you spent time looking at this department specifically.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
Each school will have different desired research topics in their job advertisement and different course structures. You can choose to write new applications for each school if you really want to personalize it. However, when I applied, I wrote one draft of the cover letter, research, and teaching statements, and spent about 20-30min modifying them for each school I applied to. 
    </p> 
    
    <h5>Interviewing</h5>
    <p>
    The interview is best described as an endurance test. It usually literally lasts 2 days. On day 1, they will fly you out and meet you for dinner. Day 2 is spent entirely with the department, including breakfast and dinner. Day 3 is a half day spent with the department, and you fly home in the afternoon. Almost all of the time is spent in meetings. Maintaining composure after hours of meetings is one of the most difficult aspects of the interview.
    </p>
    
    <p>
Once you are invited to interview, there will be some negotiation on scheduling. Each interview will be better than the last, so think about scheduling interviews at backup schools first. Balance your own schedule with the department's; you don't need to schedule back-to-back interviews if you will be too fatigued to perform well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
During this time, remember that the department is trying to impress you because they want you to accept an offer (if it is given). Use this time to try to decide if you want to work there. Look for potential issues like department politics or other things you might like or dislike.
    </p>
    
    <h6>Seminar</h6>
    <p>Every interview will include a seminar, usually around 45min with additional time for Q&A afterwards. This seminar is given to the entire faculty, and possibly some grad students. This includes faculty outside of transportation and faculty who may have expert knowledge of your research methods. Therefore, this is the most difficult seminar you will ever give because of the diverse audience and the need to impress.
    </p>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>  It's a good idea to start with a general motivation of your research for the non-related faculty and end with some numerical results (e.g. automated vehicles decrease congestion by 40%) that they can understand. You also need to talk about your research methods enough to convince the transportation faculty of your expertise. </li>
<li>Aim for the audience understanding around 80% of your talk. If they understand 100%, they may think your research is too simple to hire you. If they understand less, they might not understand why your research is valuable. My general goal is for the audience to understand the motivation and numerical results, but have limited understanding of the research methods, so they want to hire you to bring that expertise to the school. </li>
<li>End with a 3&#8211;5min discussion of your future research plans and how you intend to fund your research. </li>
<li>Practice your seminar with others (preferably your advisor, other faculty, and other grad students) before going to the interview. This practice is very important. To make the point, I did not practice for my dissertation defense, but I did practice extensively for this seminar. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h6>Meetings with faculty</h6>
    <p>Most of the interview consists of 30min meetings with individual faculty members. They are trying to determine which of the candidates they most want to work with in the following years. Try to find rapport with each faculty member. Be prepared to give a 2-3 min summary of your research, with different summaries for transportation and non-transportation faculty. This is also your best opportunity to try to infer issues with department politics or the environment. Ask tenure-track faculty how difficult it is to get tenure and how supported they are by the department. I usually email everyone I met after the interview and mention some point of connection we had. (Actually, I write the emails as soon as possible, and send them a day later.)
    </p>
    
    <h6>Meetings with grad students</h6>
    <p>This will probably not make or break your interview, but if you can find rapport with the grad students, it's definitely helpful for the search committee to get a good review from them. Since you are or recently were a grad student, you can probably relate to their experiences quite well. That being said, act and talk like you're a new faculty, not a current grad student. This is a good opportunity to find out how well grad students are supported in the department and the usual size and format of the transportation grad student program. 
    </p>
    
    <h6>Meeting the search committee</h6>
    <p>Often the search committee (together) will meet with you for an hour, in addition to meetings with the individual faculty. They will probably ask you general questions about your research goals and teaching plans, and you may be asked to prepare slides for this meeting. If there is anything you would like the search committee to know (such as a strong preference for this school), this is a good time to bring it up.
    </p>
    
    
    <h6>Meetings with the department chair</h6>
    <p>The department chair will usually have a longer meeting with you. Often, they will not be in the transportation group, so they will not be testing your expertise. Use this opportunity to ask about the department and support for new faculty, but also expect to receive the "official" answers that the department wants you to see. 
    </p>
    
    <h6>Meetings with the dean</h6>
    <p>The dean is usually fairly far removed from the search. Unless you majorly screw up here, they will probably accept the department's recommendation. This is a good opportunity to ask about college programs to support new faculty.
    </p>
    
    <h6>Scheduling</h6> 
    <p>Your interviews will usually get off schedule. There will be a very strict schedule with 30min time slots and 0 time for walking around the department or campus. Or lunches will run late and you will be late for the next meeting. The search committee will usually arrange for one of the faculty to guide you around the building. Let them fix the schedule when it gets off course.
    </p>
    
    <h6>Teaching seminar</h6>
    <p>Some schools will ask you to give a 50min lecture, like an undergraduate course lecture, but to faculty and grad students. Try to find a topic that non-transportation faculty might find surprising or learn from. One of my favorite topics is introducing traffic assignment, up to the Braess paradox.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
The search committee will usually take you to nice ($75&#8211;100 per person) restaurants for dinner, paid for by the department. Enjoy the food and use the time to get to know the faculty in a relaxed environment. Usually you will eat with some committee members and some other faculty. They will usually be fairly relaxed; for them it is also an opportunity to spend time with the other faculty. Try to relax and fit into the conversation, especially when it is not about your work.
    </p>
    
    
    <h5>Negotiating offers</h5>
    <p>
    Congratulations, you have an informal offer! Now what? At this point, the school wants to hire you (and avoid a failed search, which is expensive), so they are usually willing to negotiate on the details of the offer. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
The first rule about negotiating is that it's easier to negotiate when you have leverage (i.e. other offers). It is possible to lose an offer by asking for too much. It's easiest to negotiate if you are prepared to accept school B's offer if school A does not give you your desired level of salary or startup. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
What you can negotiate for:
    </p>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li><b>Salary.</b> Salary is somewhat important because salary growth in academia is often a % increase of your current (read starting) salary. However, department chairs usually have limits on how high they can go. If you want a high salary, my best advice is to work at a high-ranked school that pays high salaries and is also located in a city with a low cost-of-living. The cost-of-living is very important; a salary of X goes much farther in a small city like Urbana-Champaign than an expensive city like New York. Also note that salaries are usually 9-month, meaning that you need to find grant money to pay yourself for the other 3 months.</li>
<li><b>​Startup.</b> It will likely take you some time to find grants. Startup is used to hire students, buy furniture, attend conferences, and pay yourself summer salary until you start obtaining grants to support your research program. The top schools will typically offer 4 student-years of funding (which could be used to support 2 students 2 years each instead). When negotiating startup, do not simply ask for a number. Make a list of specific purchases, including student salary, computers, travel, etc. that you want, and give the list to the department chair.</li>
<li><b>Office space.</b> Do you want to have a dedicated computer lab for your students? Do you need equipment or a wet lab (e.g. driving simulator) for your research? What office do you want to have, personally? As a junior faculty, don't expect to get the nicest office, but you can ask for amenities like having a window, and money for furniture. </li>
<li><b>Teaching load.</b> As a new faculty, you want to avoid too much teaching early on, which will take away time from starting your research program. Top schools will usually require that tenure-track faculty teach only 2-3 courses per year, possibly with less during the first year. Also try to negotiate a reduction in the number of new courses taught. Each course prep takes far more time than teaching a course for a 2nd time. </li>
<li><b>2-body problem.</b> If you are married, and you want your spouse to live in the same city (or possibly even work at the same school), some schools will offer spousal hires, even in other departments. Keep in mind that finding a second faculty line is difficult. If you are negotiating for a spousal hire, you probably will have less leverage for other negotiations. </li>
<li><b>Moving costs.</b> Most schools will offer a reasonable amount to help cover your moving costs, including airfare and the costs of hiring a moving company. This money usually goes away after you move, so negotiating moving costs in excess of your actual requirements is usually not beneficial.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        These negotiations will usually be conducted over the phone and through email. Typically the department chair will call you to discuss the offer initially, with additional negotiations (such as a list of startup support) discussed over email. After you and the department chair have reached an informal agreement, they will send you a formal letter offering an employment contract (usually for 1 year). This letter is the formal offer, and once sent, the school cannot legally retract the offer. 
    </p>
    
    
    <h6>Decision time.</h6><p>Perhaps school A is giving you an offer first, but you actually prefer school B. 2 weeks is usually the standard time given for deciding whether to accept an offer <b>after the formal offer letter is sent</b>. If you want more time, slowing down the negotiation phase (e.g. by taking longer to respond) is the easiest way to delay. However, don't overdo it or the school may realize you are trying to delay. Once school A has given you an informal offer, my advice is to immediately contact the committee chair of school B, let them know of your preference, and ask them to accelerate their interview and hiring process for you if possible. Other potential ways to delay are to ask for a second campus visit, especially to show your spouse around. 
    </p>
    
    <h5>What if you don't succeed?</h5>
    
    <p>
    Because of how competitive the job market is, you should have a backup plan. Fortunately, the academic job search starts early, and alternative options are often available later after the searches are complete.
    </p>
    <ul class="disc">
    <li>Some students go into industry immediately. Obviously, it's difficult to have the same research options in industry, but it is often easier to get a job there. </li>
 <li>Students who want to stay in academia often take a postdoc to increase their research achievements before going on the job market again. However, postdocs have a "shelf life": if you spend too much time as a postdoc, search committees may start to think there's something wrong with you that makes you unhireable (even if there isn't). In transportation engineering, too much time is typically 2&#8211;3+ years. </li>
 <li>You can remain a PhD student while increasing your research achievements. This option probably is best at preserving your career prospects. Search committees often measure potential as your research achievements at the time of graduation. </li>
    </ul>
