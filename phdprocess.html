    <h3>Process of a PhD</h3>  
    <p>
    First, it's helpful to define what a PhD is. 
    <b>A PhD is an official recognition that you are capable of conducting independent research.</b>
    â€‹You earn this recognition by completing independent research of sufficient contribution to convince your dissertation committee of your skills. 
    <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/" target="_blank">Matt Might provides a nice illustration.</a>
    </p>
    
    <h6>How long does a PhD take?</h6>
    <p>In undergrad, the graduation requirements are easy: take a minimum number of credits and you have a degree. You can determine the duration by when you take those credits. In a PhD, the requirement is a significant research contribution, and it's entirely up to you how long that takes. 
    </p>
    <p>
For most students, a PhD requires 5&#8211;6 years. This includes 2 years of learning technical skills and completing a MS degree and several years of practicing research and increasing your research accomplishments until you are ready to graduate. Some students take longer or shorter. The shortest PhD I know of is by Travis Waller in 3.5 years (which included a MS degree).
    </p>
    
    
    <h5>PhD milestones</h5>
    
    <p>
There are three main milestones in the PhD program.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
    Written exam (also known as the qualifying exam). <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15FzMCgDyWozOFav4aY89FKy1cFivfe22lSfpPYupcoY/edit" target="_blank">The format is described here.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
Proposal defense (also known as the oral exam)
    </li>
    <li>
Final dissertation defense
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
You will usually take the written exam after finishing most courses, including 8xxx level transportation courses from each faculty. If you enrolled right after undergrad, you will probably take the written exam 2 years after starting (or after finishing the MS degree). If you enrolled with a MS degree, you can probably take the written exam 1 year later.]
    </p>
    
    <p>
After completing the written exam, you can write a dissertation proposal at any time. Your dissertation defense must be at least 1 semester after your proposal, but in practice that is almost never the active constraint. For more information on the proposal and dissertation defense, see how to write a dissertation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
The written exam is the faculty's way of checking that you have the breadth and technical skills to be considered a researcher in the field. Breadth requirements means taking enough transportation engineering classes to be considered a transportation engineer. Most students take these classes at UMN, but other students who enrolled after having a MS degree do not. The written exam is one way of ensuring that all students have the required knowledge.
    </p>
    
    <p>
The other goal of the written exam is to evaluate your technical skills. Your advisor will ask you to demonstrate those skills on a problem you have not worked on yet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
Students often overstress over the written exam. If you are a productive researcher, your advisor will want to keep you around. If so, you can expect to pass the written exam as long as you pass the breadth requirement. 
    </p>
    
    <h5>Common mistakes</h5>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>Students often overperform on the official requirements of coursework and PhD milestones. In reality, if you are a productive researcher, everything else will fall into place. If you are not a productive researcher, you will not be able to pass the PhD milestones anyways.</li>
   <li>Expecting hand-holding. In undergrad, everything you learned could be taught to you. Many students often try to look up the answers to their research problems. Unfortunately, if I or papers could give you the answers, then it wouldn't be research. Of course, I will do my best to tell you which techniques or skills to use, especially for newer students.</li>
   <li>Procrastinating on research. Research is difficult with few deadlines, but classes have much more visible deadlines. You will not graduate from classes alone. Don't fall into the trap of delaying your research progress to complete homework. Also see my post on time management. </li>
