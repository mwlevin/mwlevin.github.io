         <h3>What are we supposed to do at conferences?</h3>
         
         <p>
         Conferences (especially large ones like TRB) are overwhelming the first time you attend. I see many students not prioritizing goals at conferences.
         </p>
         <p>
In transportation engineering, most research is recorded as journal publications. Conference proceedings are not given nearly as much weight. Therefore, focus on the networking aspects of conferences. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
Here are the main goals that I advise you to have as a grad student:
         </p>
         <ul class="disc">
<li>Advertise your research. As a grad student, your advisor is known in the research community, but you are not. You want other faculty to start becoming aware of your work. Some of those faculty may decide whether to hire you in a few years. Others may become your next collaborators on a research paper or grant proposal.</li>
<li>Become aware of related research by attending presentations. Other researchers are working on similar problems and are here to advertise their research. Their solutions might be useful for your work. It is also helpful to have some general knowledge about related work. However, do not go overboard on this goal. Attend a realistic number of sessions, but do not get burned out. </li>
<li>Networking. As you read papers, you will start to see some faculty names repeated. You can meet these faculty at the conference. As a grad student, I often did not see the point of meeting these faculty, and had difficulty remembering them. It takes repeated meetings over multiple conferences over several years to start knowing the other researchers in your area. Start while you are a grad student and you will have a network when you are a new faculty. This network is useful when finding collaborators, applying for faculty jobs, seeking career advancement (like being invited to editorial boards and conference committees), and finding letter writers for the tenure application.</li>
<li>I spend most of my time at conferences talking with other faculty. If you spend time with me, I will introduce you as my students. You might find the conversation boring, but try to participate as you are building those connections. </li>
<li>Start participating in the research community. You are a (junior) researcher, which means that you have results to present, like most of the other researchers there. See yourself as an active participant in the research discussions rather than a consumer of presentations. Feel free to ask questions of presenters, either during the allotted Q&A time or right after sessions 1-on-1. </li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>
Conferences are often held in cities with major tourist attractions. Use the conference as a chance to spend some time in the city with free airfare, such as by arriving earlier or staying later. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
Here are some more specifics for the two conferences we usually attend.
         </p>
         
         
         <h5>Transportation Research Board (TRB)</h5>
         <p>
         TRB is held in January in Washington D.C. each year. Most of the conference fits within Sunday morning through Wednesday afternoon. I usually arrive late on Saturday or early on Sunday, depending on the schedule that year, and take the last flight out on Wednesday afternoon after the Network Modeling Committee poster session. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
Most of our work is related to the Network Modeling Committee (AEP40, previously ADB30). Focus on attending their sessions. There are 3 types of sessions:
         </p>
         <ol>
<li><b>Short presentations</b>. I find these to be the least useful, but you are guaranteed to find researchers in attendance if you want to meet them. This is also a good opportunity to get a general idea of what other researchers are working on.</li>
<li><b>Poster session</b>, usually on Wednesday afternoon. This is highly useful as you get to talk to authors about their research. If you are presenting a poster, don't stand by the poster the entire time. Leave a stack of business cards by your poster for half the time and go talk to other presenters about their posters.</li>
<li><b>Subcommittee meetings</b>. These are very useful for networking. Researchers who care about the topic will gather in a room to introduce themselves, discuss general issues, and advertise upcoming conferences. I usually attend the Network Equilibrium and Emerging Technologies subcommittees. Use these meetings for networking. The main committee meeting is usually less interesting, but still worth attending once in a while.</li>
<li><b>Workshops</b>. These are on Sunday morning and afternoon, and usually feature invited presentations on a specific topic. Sometimes they are useful.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>
At TRB, it's easy to fall into the trap of trying to attend everything and getting burned out. In particular, if you search for sessions on "automated vehicles" or similar, you will find plenty of work using unrelated research methods like policy analyses. Prioritize attending the Network Modeling Committee sessions, and attend others if you have time.
         </p>
         
         <p>
During your last year as a grad student, there is a dissertation presentation competition supported by the Network Modeling Committee, which is again free advertising for your job search.
         </p>

         <h6>Receptions</h6>         
         <p>
This is highly important for networking. Each school and large company usually hosts a reception sometime during the week. The company receptions have better food, but the school receptions are where you can meet faculty. On Sunday, I recommend you attend the UMN, UT Austin, UIUC, and Northwestern receptions. The locations and times are not advertised. Usually, UT Austin is at 7-8:30pm, and UIUC and Northwestern are simultaneous and last until 10pm. They are usually somewhere in the Marriott hotel, and are fairly well marked if you walk by. Other notable receptions include the Australian reception on Monday, usually in the VaPiano restaurant around 6pm. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
To explain why I attend these specific receptions, my advisor (Steve Boyles) is at UT Austin, and my advisor's advisor (Travis Waller), who I also worked with, is at UNSW Sydney and graduated from Northwestern. Depending on your network, you may find other receptions to attend also. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
If you are on the job market,  attend the reception of any schools you applied to. I was able to meet faculty and even receive some informal interview offers during the receptions. 
         </p>



         <p>
TRB presentations are due on Aug. 1 each year. (Technically it has to be Aug. 1 somewhere in the world, which means it is due around Aug. 2 at 5am for us. I do not recommend waiting until this deadline.) TRB presentations are a full paper submission with a 7500 word limit, and are peer reviewed. You can also opt to publish in TRR, but your best work is often better off being presented in TRB and published in a more highly ranked journal like Part B or Part C. TRR is often looked down upon as a conference proceedings (even though it isn't, and is actually quite difficult to get into). It's ok to have some papers in TRR, especially if you're going after the paper awards, but don't only publish in TRR.
         </p>
         
         <h5>Institute For Operations Research and Management Sciences (INFORMS)</h5>
         
         <p>
         INFORMS is held in October-November each year at different cities in the continental U.S. Most of the main conference fits within Sunday morning through Wednesday afternoon. INFORMS is focused on operations research, with a significant interest group around transportation (the Transportation Science & Logistics community). Therefore, much of the conference is less relevant for us. Most of your time will probably be spent at TSL sessions, and there are usually 4-5 concurrent TSL sessions. Like TRB, these sessions are great opportunities to network with related researchers. TSL also has a business meeting Monday night, which is basically a reception for TSL members and networking followed by some announcements about TSL and Transportation Science.
         </p>
         
         <p>
Other notable receptions include the general receptions on Sunday night and Tuesday night, both of which include dinner and are usually quite enjoyable. INFORMS is also a good place to look for industry jobs in the exhibit hall. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
INFORMS presentations only require an abstract, due around May 15. These are barely peer-reviewed (acceptance is highly likely). Although only an abstract is required, I personally require you to complete at least the methodology of your presentation prior to submission. This is to ensure that you will actually have something to present at the conference (yes, I have witnessed other students withdrawing presentations due to lack of results).
         </p>
         
         
         <h5>Dynamic Traffic Assignment Symposium</h5>
         
         <p>
         DTA Symposium is usually a small (~200 people) conference focused on dynamic network modeling. It's a great networking opportunity as almost everyone there has related research, and you will see the same people throughout the conference. The conference usually requires an extended 4-page abstract, with an optional full paper submission for a special issue.
         </p>
     
         <h5>TRISTAN</h5>
         <p>TRISTAN is held every 3 years on an island somewhere, usually in a very tourist-oriented location. It is also a small conference (~200 people) with many related researchers.
         </p>
     
         <h5>IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)</h5>
         <p>
         IEEE ITSC is held every year in different cities around the world, and is the same community which organizes the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems journal. I found the attendance to be more oriented towards the traffic flow theory and controls communities instead of network modeling, 6 page (IEEE format) papers are required for presentation with full peer review and conference proceedings. It is possible to extend the work published in the proceedings for a full journal paper elsewhere.
