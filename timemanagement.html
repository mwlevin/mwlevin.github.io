         <h3>Time management</h3>
         <p>
         In grad school, and even more so as a faculty member, there are many demands on your time. Most of you were probably scoring at the top of your class in undergrad. In contrast, you will likely find it is impossible to maintain a healthy work-life balance while also performing 100% on every task in grad school. Learning healthy time management is essential to having an enjoyable grad school experience.
         </p>
         
         <h5>Eisenhower square for categorizing tasks</h5>
         
         <p>
         Former president Dwight D. Eisenhower categorized tasks by their urgency and importance.
         </p>
         
         <img src="images/eisenhowersquare.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
         
         <p>
         Some tasks are both important and urgent, such as an upcoming conference deadline. Other tasks are important but not urgent, like writing a research paper (without a hard deadline). Some tasks are urgent but not important, like registering for classes. Still other tasks are neither important nor urgent.
         </p>
         
         <p>
Many people confuse urgency and importance. In other words, they spend a lot of time on tasks that are urgent but not important because of the looming deadline. Tasks that are important but not urgent, such as research, are also often difficult, and are therefore procrastinated. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
Set aside time each day for tasks that are important but not urgent (like research). As a new faculty member, I was advised to set aside 30min for writing each day. As a graduate student, you want to spend as much time on research as possible. Learn to spend just enough time to perform adequately on other requirements, then spend your remaining time on research.
         </p>
         
         
         <h5>Level of performance</h5>
         
         <p>
         New grad students often overperform on less important tasks, which takes away time that you could use for research. Some of the common overperformance includes:
         </p>
         <ul class="disc">
         <li><b>Coursework</b>. In undergrad, the average grade might have been a C+ or B-. In grad school, the average grade is A-. In other words, if you are slightly above average in your classes, you will earn good grades. You are almost guaranteed a B if you keep up with the class. Many grad courses include a research project. If you can write a research paper that uses skills from the course, you can get a journal paper and a grade from that one project.</li>
         <li><b>Reading papers</b>. Much of grad school is spent reading papers to learn a topic. Do not read a paper word-for-word. Learn how to read papers efficiently to minimize the time spent. This is especially true when writing a literature review. </li>
<li><b>Preparing for presentations</b>. I have known some grad students to practice obsessively for presentations, both for conferences and for group meetings. After spending months on a research project to have results for presentation, you should know the details without needing to practice a script. Rehearse enough so that you know the flow of the presentation. See my post on how to present.</li>
â€‹</ul>
         <p>
These tasks are especially enticing because you can always perform better on them (you will never achieve perfection). Focus on performing just well enough to be adequate so that you have more time to spend on research.
         </p>   
         
         <h5>Procrastination</h5>
         
         <p>
             Everyone procrastinates. You can procrastinate efficiently by switching to different work tasks. This is one reason I advise students to have 3 projects they are working on simultaneously. When you are stuck on one project, or simply don't feel like working on it, switch to another one. This goes for tasks like coursework also, but don't fall into the trap of spending all your time on coursework to procrastinate on research.
         </p>
         
         <h5>How much time should I spend on grad school?</h5>
         
         <p>
         I see this question often, usually tied with work-life balance. I'll give both the official answer, and the answer that helps you succeed.
         </p>
         
         <p>
Officially, your tuition and stipend as a graduate research/teaching assistant comes from spending 20hrs per week on the sponsored project or teaching assistantship. The reason it is only 20hrs is because your remaining time should be spent on coursework and on the research that is required for graduation.
         </p>
         
         <p>
Unofficially, if you are looking for the minimum time required per week, you're asking the wrong question. 
Your primary goal in grad school is to fulfill the graduation requirements, and for most students the active constraint on graduation is completing enough research for a thesis.
I can't say whether X amount of time per week is sufficient for any individual person to meet expectations about progress. 
I do not know how much time you spend working; I don't even know how much time you spend in the office. In grad school and academia, you are evaluated on your productivity: how much research you produce, how you perform on courses, etc. Some people spend 60hrs/week in the office but spend half of that time on Facebook. Other people spend only 40hrs, but that entire 40hrs is spent on useful work.
         </p>
         
         <p>
             Peter Stone, a professor at UT Austin, says that <q>research is what you do when it is not scheduled fun time.</q> Have you ever been obsessed with something? For me, that might learning a new piano piece, mastering a video game, and sometimes, a research project. You should aim to choose research projects that are so inspiring to you that you want to think about them whenever you have free time. 

         </p>
         
         <p>
I cannot promise that spending X amount of time will be sufficient for a MS thesis or a PhD dissertation. It varies for each person. However, I hope that you are so motivated by your project that you enjoy the time you spend on it.
         </p>
         
         <p>
Sponsored project work and teaching assistantship are evaluated on deliverables (i.e. project reports, models, simulations, grading, TA sessions). You may be able to perform adequately on these deliverables in less than 20hrs/week, and I highly encourage it if you can. 
         </p>
         <p>
             
             Overall, you should view time management as <q>what is the minimum time I can spend on different required tasks so I can maximize the time spent on my primary goal (e.g. research towards a thesis)?</q>
         </p>
         
         <h5>Scheduling for productivity</h5>
         
         <p>
         Academia 
         is extremely flexible in scheduling. With the exception of courses and meetings, there are almost no requirements on when you are working. I had friends who would wake up and arrive in the office at 1pm each day (and who were probably in the office far later than me). For myself, I find that I am most productive when I am inspired by a project (which could be a research paper or creating a new class). When inspired, I will easily work 10+hr days, including late at night. When I'm not inspired, I'm usually browsing papers or thinking about traffic in a conceptual, non-technical way to find inspiration. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
This scheduling flexibility extends to vacations. When you are productive in your research, good advisors will not care how much time you spend on campus or even in another country.
